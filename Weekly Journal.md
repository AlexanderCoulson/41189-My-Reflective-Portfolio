# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week

This week I have learnt what complex systems and complex adaptive systems are, as well as how they can be implemented and be made useful in my IS degree/career

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now know and understand the basics of complex systems and also complex adaptive systems for that matter. I understand now how to look at a system and recognise what data I can take away from each system, rather that looking at the model on face value.

### What insights have I gained?

I have realised that systems can be more complex than what they seem on face value and that systems are not random as I once believed.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have observed in myself the strength of being able to see and understand patterns in systems, though my weakness lies where I can be overwhelmed by large amounts of data at once. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

There were not many challenges in week 1 as it was only the groundwork for future workshops being laid.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Summarise and thoroughly look over information provided to make sense of it and understand it better

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

No theories were in week 1 to my knowledge


## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?

I have learnt firstly about how to read/evaluate different complex systems simply and properly. Furthermore, I have learnt about many different models and the science of many models.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I know about the science of many models which in itself was very interesting. 
### What insights have I gained?

Learning about how to use certain models is definitely a worthy insight as I know have the ability and knowledge to read and analyse certain systems.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have noticed that I can be quick to grasp information though and I need to dedicate more time to work to further understand and place information in my long-term memory
 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

The challenges I experienced was an increase in content and hence with other commitments, content became a struggle to study and summarise 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I will be making more time for my studies as of next week with the expectation of summarising and studying the content properly.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The Condorcet theory proved to be very useful. In laymanâ€™s terms, it is the use of many different view points to focus on one problem and gaining as ideas as possible.


## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt about new models such as the rational, behavioural and rule-based models.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The ability to use decision trees and the utilise probability to my advantage in all aspects of my life. 

### What insights have I gained?

One insight I have gained is the value of information and data to support decisions.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I perceive my strengths to be relating the systems and theories learnt in this module to my life therefore making it easier to understand. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

One challenge would be the problem solving in a group scenario, where everyone has different perspectives on how a problem should be tackled. Collating these perspectives, configuring, and organising these comes as a challenge

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Next time I will be better organised with my group projects. Writing things down allows from greater organisation as things can be physically seen instead of imagined and then confused.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The Costly Signalling theory as it is relatable to real life and decision making outside my academic work.


## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt the detailed example of a system, system dynamics and ways in which system dynamics can be utilised. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now know how important system dynamics are in the real world and how they can be used for modelling. Furthermore, how outside variables can affect the system.

### What insights have I gained?

One piece of insight I have gained is that i now understand and am able to implement system dynamics in my own personal life through the studies I have undertaken this week. One such example is pizza house example which highlighted how to utilise system dynamics to its full effect.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have viewed in myself the ability to apply variables to systems in an accurate and efficient way, therefore creating a more precise system and model.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Challenges I faced included understanding and answering questions on different types of networks, as I found them confusing at times.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I will be doing increased reading on areas I felt I could excel more at, including networks, in order to better understand the content before the final assignment submission.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Once properly understood the network theory seemed most useful as I felt it had many similarities to real world situations such as the growth of certain social media platforms and the users within them for example. From this it has been interesting to study and view, as mentioned previously, the trends and growth patterns of users and applications alike on the internet.
