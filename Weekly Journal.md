# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week

This week I have learnt what complex systems and complex adaptive systems are, as well as how they can be implemented and be made useful in my IS degree/career

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now know and understand the basics of complex systems and also complex adaptive systems for that matter. I understand now how to look at a system and recognise what data I can take away from each system, rather that looking at the model on face value.

### What insights have I gained?

I have realised that systems can be more complex than what they seem on face value and that systems are not random as I once believed.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have observed in myself the strength of being able to see and understand patterns in systems, though my weakness lies where I can be overwhelmed by large amounts of data at once. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

There were not many challenges in week 1 as it was only the groundwork for future workshops being laid.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Summarise and thoroughly look over information provided to make sense of it and understand it better

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

No theories were in week 1 to my knowledge


## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?

I have learnt firstly about how to read/evaluate different complex systems simply and properly. Furthermore, I have learnt about many different models and the science of many models.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I know about the science of many models which in itself was very interesting. 
### What insights have I gained?

Learning about how to use certain models is definitely a worthy insight as I know have the ability and knowledge to read and analyse certain systems.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have noticed that I can be quick to grasp information though and I need to dedicate more time to work to further understand and place information in my long-term memory
 
### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

The challenges I experienced was an increase in content and hence with other commitments, content became a struggle to study and summarise 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I will be making more time for my studies as of next week with the expectation of summarising and studying the content properly.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The Condorcet theory proved to be very useful. In layman’s terms, it is the use of many different view points to focus on one problem and gaining as ideas as possible.


## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt about new models such as the rational, behavioural and rule-based models.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

The ability to use decision trees and the utilise probability to my advantage in all aspects of my life. 

### What insights have I gained?

One insight I have gained is the value of information and data to support decisions.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I perceive my strengths to be relating the systems and theories learnt in this module to my life therefore making it easier to understand. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

One challenge would be the problem solving in a group scenario, where everyone has different perspectives on how a problem should be tackled. Collating these perspectives, configuring, and organising these comes as a challenge

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Next time I will be better organised with my group projects. Writing things down allows from greater organisation as things can be physically seen instead of imagined and then confused.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

The Costly Signalling theory as it is relatable to real life and decision making outside my academic work.


## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt the detailed example of a system, system dynamics and ways in which system dynamics can be utilised. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now know how important system dynamics are in the real world and how they can be used for modelling. Furthermore, how outside variables can affect the system.

### What insights have I gained?

One piece of insight I have gained is that i now understand and am able to implement system dynamics in my own personal life through the studies I have undertaken this week. One such example is pizza house example which highlighted how to utilise system dynamics to its full effect.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have viewed in myself the ability to apply variables to systems in an accurate and efficient way, therefore creating a more precise system and model.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Challenges I faced included understanding and answering questions on different types of networks, as I found them confusing at times.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I will be doing increased reading on areas I felt I could excel more at, including networks, in order to better understand the content before the final assignment submission.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Once properly understood the network theory seemed most useful as I felt it had many similarities to real world situations such as the growth of certain social media platforms and the users within them for example. From this it has been interesting to study and view, as mentioned previously, the trends and growth patterns of users and applications alike on the internet.

## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I have learnt about the importance of probability and statistics in systems and how they can effect different systems by introducing variables 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

This topic was already taught to me during high school, therefore I already had knowledge of this information.

### What insights have I gained?

One insight I have been gained is the ability to calculate and plot bell curves which gives and clear and accurate view of the data found. Therefore making it easier to translate this data into a system format.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have found a strength of mine to be the mathematical aspect of the bell curves as I have done a previous statistics for business unit at Western Sydney University

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

The main challenge I faced was, as described in the text, characterising the different variables in order to apply them to the systems. I overcame this through writing down all the different variables and matching them to characteristics so I could physically see what linked where to give a clearer picture.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Next time I will be writing down anything that is unclear so I can better understand it. Writing it down seems to present a clearer picture for me .

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Linear models in the self study section seemed to most useful as it made use of prior knowledge of linear graphs showing an average then plotting other data around it to highlight how close individual data was to the average marker. 

## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I have learnt many things including, the markov model, convexity and concavity as well as the Granovetter theory.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I know of the markov model. The markov model puts systems into perspective by describing and highlighting a how something can transform from one state into another.

### What insights have I gained?

The Granovetter theory as mentioned later in this weekly reflection, was the most insightful piece of knowledge gained this week. This was due to it being so relatable to events and scenarios happening in the world around us today.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

This week I have perceived no obvious strengths and weaknesses that I have no mentioned previously. I still find heavy mathematics to be a weakness if I have not previously been taught it.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

This week I was particularly challenged by the mathematics. It became quite complex especially when solving problems related to the SIR Model.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
As with most previous weeks I will focus on practicing the mathematics needed for this sub-topic in order to better my understanding for upcoming weeks.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The Granovetter theory seemed to be most useful as it explained many real world scenarios and the reason as to why and how these scenarios grow so rapidly, such as the current riots in the United States of America.

## Week 7

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt about Schelling’s segregation model as well as the standing ovation model. In addition, I also learnt about culture and its impact on systems and models

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now know how schelling segregation model can be applied to everyday life and how problems related to the problem can be solved.

### What insights have I gained?

An insight I have gained is how culture and other characteristics of human beings are so relevant in the creation of models
### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

This week, as with last week I did not perceive in strengths or weakness’ in myself as this week seemed to be a relatively content based week that was not difficult.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Challenges I experienced this week only came with the time I had allocated for my studies this week as I found it difficult to fit in my studies with my work schedule. As for next week I will be taking more time off work to continue with my studies. I will also endeavour to make this habit until the end of semester.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Same as previous answer


## Week 8

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I learnt about the colonel blotto game and the prisoners dilemma.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now and understand the prisoners dilemma

### What insights have I gained?

The insight which I have gained is through the colonel blotto game which suggests that no one model can be used for the most accuracy, though a combination of many is most useful.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have found that with a lot of data I become overwhelmed and cannot focus on the problem at hand. I overcome this by writing down and summarising all the data collected in order to simply it for easier reading.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

This week I encountered challenges with using GitHub and accessing my code and files. I overcame this by asking my team mates questions and looking up answers on the internet

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

No theories used this week


### Week 9 

This week i have structured the journal differently as there was no content taught. This will be the same for the subsequent weeks up until week 12.

Week 9 our group worked on our pre-submission. We used Facebook Messenger to communicate with each other, with Evan Hunter as our coordinatior and leader. 
I found it difficult to use github as i wasnt aware of how it properly worked as i entered my group late and so wasnt sure on how to use Github. Eventually after consultation
with my group i found out how to use Github and get our pre-submission out successfully.
