# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week

This week I have learnt what complex systems and complex adaptive systems are, as well as how they can be implemented and be made useful in my IS degree/career

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now know and understand the basics of complex systems and also complex adaptive systems for that matter. I understand now how to look at a system and recognise what data I can take away from each system, rather that looking at the model on face value.

### What insights have I gained?

I have realised that systems can be more complex than what they seem on face value and that systems are not random as I once believed.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I have observed in myself the strength of being able to see and understand patterns in systems, though my weakness lies where I can be overwhelmed by large amounts of data at once. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

There were not many challenges in week 1 as it was only the groundwork for future workshops being laid.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Summarise and thoroughly look over information provided to make sense of it and understand it better

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

No theories were in week 1 to my knowledge
